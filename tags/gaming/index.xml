It&amp;rsquo;s been many years since the last time I made a game from scrath so it seemed fitting to give that a go.
I chose Tetris because it&amp;rsquo;s a well known game, with a defined set of problems and functionality. All I had to worry about was to code their solutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I did get more familiar with TypeScript, some of its strengths, caveats and tooling. Still, it would be hard (or overengineered) to cover all of the language features in a project. One important feature I left out is &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html">generics&lt;/a>, perhaps I need to start working on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders&lt;/a> now so I can give it a try?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
