&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/marinhero/rpemax">This&lt;/a> is a program that automates the process we follow at my gym to calculate the weight we should lift in our sets based on our RPE, one rep max, and set count.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-rpe">What is RPE?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>RPE stands for Rate of Perceived Exertion. It is a subjective measure used to gauge the intensity of exercise or physical activity, based on an individual&amp;rsquo;s personal perception of how hard they feel they are working.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tetris, in TypeScript</title><link>https://marinhero.com/posts/typescript-tetris/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marinhero.com/posts/typescript-tetris/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the intention of getting more familiarized with TypeScript, I decided to start a new project.
It&amp;rsquo;s been many years since the last time I made a game from scrath so it seemed fitting to give that a go.
I chose Tetris because it&amp;rsquo;s a well known game, with a defined set of problems and functionality. All I had to worry about was to code their solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-typescript-lesson">The TypeScript Lesson&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I did get more familiar with TypeScript, some of its strengths, caveats and tooling. Still, it would be hard (or overengineered) to cover all of the language features in a project. One important feature I left out is &lt;a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html">generics&lt;/a>, perhaps I need to start working on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders">Space Invaders&lt;/a> now so I can give it a try?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
