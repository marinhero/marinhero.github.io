I Just Want to Download my Program!</title><link>https://marinhero.com/posts/architectures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marinhero.com/posts/architectures/</guid><description>&lt;p>More often than not, when I go to a website to download a program I find a screen like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ufm7b20.png" alt="Downloads">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of the questions that come to my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Why are there so many options?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why don&amp;rsquo;t we just create one universal binary format so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to decide this?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aren&amp;rsquo;t computers supposed to just &lt;strong>speak&lt;/strong> in zeroes and ones?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What happens if I download the wrong binary?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are architectures compatible with each other?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I usually know the architecture of the CPU my computer is running, so the decision-making process is straightforward, but I don’t really know the real reason behind picking one binary over another. I decided to clear that doubt from my mind, and hopefully, these answers will clarify the questions for you too.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
