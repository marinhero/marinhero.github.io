Last summer, I had the opportunity to mentor an intern at Twilio Segment. This was a first for me and I really enjoyed it.
The experience opened a new avenenue for my career that I want to keep exploring.

By the end of the internship, Kevin (the intern) and I co-wrote a blogpost with some of our learnings and titled it [do’s and don’ts for a successful SDE internship](https://segment.com/blog/dos-and-donts-for-successful-sde-internship/) go check it out!
