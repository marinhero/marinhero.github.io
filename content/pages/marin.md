Hello! I'm Mar√≠n Alcaraz. I work as a Staff Software Engineer for [Twilio - Segment](https://segment.com).

I studied Computer Systems Engineering at [ITESM](https://tec.mx) with a brief, but awesome stint at [EPITECH](http://www.epitech.eu).

After, college I went to the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and had the time of my life building cool software projects, like a Dropbox clone or my own ad-blocker.

I moved to The Bay Area in 2015 to join Wootric as their 2nd hire. I worked there as a Software Engineer until the company was acquired in 2020.

I'm passionate about Infrastructure, Information Security, Ruby, Golang, and TypeScript.

When I'm away from my keyboard you can find me singing, dancing [Rueda de Casino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rueda_de_Casino), or [riding](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9416766) my bike. I dream of riding the [Baja Divide](https://bikepacking.com/routes/baja-divide/) one day.
