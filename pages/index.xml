I&amp;rsquo;m Marín Alcaraz. I work as a Staff Software Engineer for &lt;a href="https://segment.com">Twilio - Segment&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I studied Computer Systems Engineering at &lt;a href="https://tec.mx">ITESM&lt;/a> with a brief, but awesome stint at &lt;a href="http://www.epitech.eu">EPITECH&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After, college I went to the &lt;a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center&lt;/a> and had the time of my life building cool software projects, like a Dropbox clone or my own ad-blocker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I moved to The Bay Area in 2015 to join Wootric as their 2nd hire. I worked there as a Software Engineer until the company was acquired in 2020.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
