      <description>I had a bad experience with the Sieve of Eratosthenes during a college test, I became traumatized by it and tried to avoid it. During this holiday break I decided to face my fears (lol) and successfully implemented it ruby (not very idiomatic but ruby still)
My favorite parts of this algorithm were:
 The fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to iterate the whole sieve! I can do it just for _sqrt(n) _since the factors of any number are always composed by two numbers and one of them is always lower than the sqrt of any given number n.</description>
